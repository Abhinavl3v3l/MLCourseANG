# WEEK 1

#### 	1. Introduction 

1. **Machine Learning Intro**

   - Machine Learning from data.
   - Giving a machine the ability to learn a particular task by feeding it data related to task
   - With the expectation that machine can do a similar task giving it a new similar data
   - A machines ability to performs a task T gaining experience E  with respect to performance P
   - A machines ability to learn a task T and is judged with respect to a performance threshold  P performing p  hence gaining experience E. If a same program can run the same task T with an performance P > p' > p then machine has learned to perform a task a little better hence gaining more experience  E
   -  A program is said to learn from experience E performing a task T with respect to a performance  measure P if its performance at task T increases with experience E.
     - T - Playing Carrom
     - E -  Experience of playing Carrom
     - P - Probability of winning at Carrom
   - Machine Learning is classified into **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**.
   - Examples of Machine Learning : 
     - Audio to Text
     - Video Recognition
     - Image to Text prediction
     - Driving cars
     - Playing a board game

2. **Supervised Learning**

   1. Supervised Learning follows the model  $\theta X\rightarrow Y$
   2. Where $\theta$ is a feature and $X,Y \in \real$
   3. Supervised Learning is w
